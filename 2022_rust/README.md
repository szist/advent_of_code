Most of the code is mostly just trying out and learning rust. None of the code is meant to be
examplary nor effecitve. The goal was to try out as many features of the language as possible
while having some fun.

* Day1 - first attempts, just trying to write C-style
* Day2 - learning a bit about modules and pattern matching
* Day3 - checking out collections, still unsure about reference/dereferencing - probably very bad
* Day4 - not time to learn today new things, ugly af
* Day5 - trying out structs and regex crates
* Day6 - not trying anything fancy, could be done in O(1) space to check for duplicates probably at the cost of readability
* Day7 - trying out parser, missing a lot of knowledge about `Rc<>` & `RefCell` so not pretty, took too long to do, so no cleanup
* Day8 - "it ain't pretty, but it works", just a lot of manual matrix traversal. Trying out mutable refs.
* Day9 - playing around with cloning and references
* Day10 - trying out enums a second time and some custom step loops with some vector shorthands as a cherry on top
* Day11 - couldn't be bothered with parsing again, so trying out dynamic functions in structs :)
