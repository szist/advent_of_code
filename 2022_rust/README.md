Most of the code is mostly just trying out and learning rust. The quality might be very low.

* Day1 - first attempts, just trying to write C-style
* Day2 - learning a bit about modules and pattern matching
* Day3 - checking out collections, still unsure about reference/dereferencing - probably very bad
* Day4 - not time to learn today new things, ugly af
* Day5 - trying out structs and regex crates
* Day6 - not trying anything fancy, could be done in O(1) space to check for duplicates probably at the cost of readability
* Day7 - trying out parser, missing a lot of knowledge about `Rc<>` & `RefCell` so not pretty, took too long to do, so no cleanup
* Day8 - "it ain't pretty, but it works", just a lot of manual matrix traversal. Trying out mutable refs.
* Day9 - playing around with cloning and references
