Most of the code is mostly just trying out and learning rust. The quality might be very low.

* Day1 - first attempts, just trying to write C-style
* Day2 - learning a bit about modules and pattern matching
* Day3 - checking out collections, still unsure about reference/dereferencing - probably very bad
